Portrait Composition
-----------------------

- Keep in mind that the body part closest to the camera always looks bigger
- If you get the subject to move their hip away from the camera they start to
  look slimmer
- You can play with this to make for interesting shots
- For example if a person has beautiful eyes and you want to focus on that,
  taking a shot from a higher POV will make them pop out more
- The angle of the shot can and will affect the feel of the shot
- DO NOT CUT THE IMAGE AT WEIRD BODY PARTS
  - Leave enough snace above the head
  - Don't cut the image at like elbows, fingers etc
  - Don't be afraid to move in closer
